Machine learning predictive stock analysis.
Predictive Analytics of S&P 500 Stock Performance

This project explores whether historical market data can be used to predict future stock performance within the S&P 500 using machine learning and data analysis techniques. Working as a group, we analyzed trends, engineered features, and evaluated predictive models against real market outcomes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

- Analyze historical S&P 500 stock data (2013–2018)

- Build predictive models to classify profitable vs. non-profitable trading days

- Test model performance on unseen future data (2018–2023)

- Compare machine-learning-based strategies to baseline market performance

This project emphasizes end-to-end data science, from raw data exploration to model evaluation and interpretation.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of large financial datasets

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including:

  - Price trends and volatility analysis

  - Correlation heatmaps

  - Growth and performance rankings

- Feature engineering for predictive modeling

- Implementation and evaluation of:

  - Random Forest Classifier

  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Model performance comparison against benchmark strategies

- Clear visualizations and explanations for interpretability

## Technologies

- Python

- Pandas & NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib & Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebooks

- GitHub Pages (for project presentation)

## Results

- Machine learning models showed varying success depending on market conditions

- Random Forest generally outperformed simpler models in classification accuracy

- Results highlight both the potential and limitations of predictive modeling in financial markets

- Demonstrated the importance of feature selection, validation on future data, and realistic benchmarking
